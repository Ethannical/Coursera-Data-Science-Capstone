# 1. Coursera Data Science Capstone

  **Coursera Data Science Capstone 07-Oct-2015** *by Johns Hopkins University*

## 1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling - Milestone-Report

### Instructions

  The goal of this project is just to display that you've gotten used to working with the data and that you are on track to create your prediction algorithm. Please submit a report on R Pubs (<http://rpubs.com/>) that explains your exploratory analysis and your goals for the eventual app and algorithm. This document should be concise and explain only the major features of the data you have identified and briefly summarize your plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app in a way that would be understandable to a non-data scientist manager. You should make use of tables and plots to illustrate important summaries of the data set. The motivation for this project is to:

  - 1. Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
  - 2. Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
  - 3. Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
  - 4. Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app.

## 1.2 Final Project Submission

### Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

  - A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
  - A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations>) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

# 2. Extra Shiny App

You can run the shinyapp by running below codes.

```{r shinyapp1}
shiny::runGitHub('englianhu/Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone', subdir='Natural-Language-Analysis')
```

or below codes if you desired display the source codes on the shinyapp.

```{r shinyapp2}
shiny::runGitHub('englianhu/Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone', subdir='Natural-Language-Analysis', display.mode='showcase')
```

You can try the browse over the shinyapp via <https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/englianhu/Natural-Language-Analysis/>.
